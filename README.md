## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (DON'T SCREW THIS UP)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smoressy/chatgpt-but-better.git
cd chatgpt-but-better
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If you don't know what this means... seriously, just copy-paste it.

### 3. ⚙️ Setting Up API Access

**IF YOU WANT GPT-4 TO WORK:**  
You **MUST** install [gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free) locally.  

- Follow their setup guide to run it.  
- This acts as the bridge to GPT-4 **without** you selling your soul for OpenAI credits.

---

### 4. 🔑 Setting Up API Keys (Or It Won't Work)

**Brave Search API Key:**  
- Go to [https://search.brave.com/settings](https://search.brave.com/settings) and create an API key.
- **Replace** the placeholder key in the project files.

**Gemini (Google AI) API Keys:**  
- Create a `.env` file in the **root** folder.
- Add your keys like this:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_really_secret_key_here
```

Don't leak this key. If you do, cry quietly into your pillow.

---

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
node s.js
```
Or if your main file is different:

```bash
node YOUR_MAIN_FILE.js
```

Congrats, if you see "Server is running," you somehow didn’t screw it up. 🎉
